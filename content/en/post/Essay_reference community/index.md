# **Introduction to my research interests**

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Mechanical Engineering in Politecnico di Milano and the School of Aeronautic Science and Engineering in Beihang University in the disciplines of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautical Engineering, respectively. During my first two years at Beihang University, I concentrated on researching structural integrity and digital twin of aeronautical structures, which allowed me to explore the concept of digital twins and their relevance to aeronautical engineering. I was able to identify and implement innovative ways to use digital twins to enhance the overall structural integrity of aeronautical structures. In 2021, I decided to pursue a double Ph.D. degree in Politecnico di Milano. Here, my research was combined with the structural health monitoring (SHM), an essential aspect of ensuring aeronautical structures' safety and longevity. Machine learning also played a significant role in my research, particularly in the development of surrogate models for complex structural simulations. Throughout my research journey, I have published seven articles in mainstream peer-reviewed journals in aeronautical and mechanical engineering, which is also listed in the Appendix.

In the following sections, my research community are analyzed through the Classification Criteria of Several Countries, the web of science platform and the ResearchGate, a well-known online academic website. The identified communities become progressively smaller in scope, thus providing multiple scales of perspective.

![图表, 树状图描述已自动生成](Aspose.Words.1c5c2640-dce2-4dcb-a713-6c480f6d4e61.001.png)

**Fig. 1 Web of Science categories of the queried publications.**

Fig. 1 revealed a diverse range of disciplines in the community, with mechanical engineering being the most dominant, followed by the materials science multidisciplinary, civil engineering, and mechanics. The aerospace engineering only ranks 13, which implies that it is relatively small compared to the previous disciplines. This finding highlights the fact that structural integrity and health monitoring issues apply to a wide range of engineering structures and are closely related to materials and mechanics, hence lending high credibility to this result. In light of these results, it is clear that I need to broaden my focus beyond the traditional disciplines to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field, by which I can explore new avenues of research and engage in interdisciplinary collaborations that could lead to significant breakthroughs.

Nevertheless, the findings reveal distinct characteristics of the research community closely aligned with my work. Disciplinary-wise, mechanical engineering and aeronautical engineering exhibit a greater inclination within my research community. Geographically, China, Italy, and the United States emerge as dominant regions, although researchers from other countries are also represented. Institutionally, my research community is concentrated in my two PhD university, Beihang University and Politecnico di Milano, while also dispersed across several engineering universities in China and a few institutions worldwide.
# **Conclusion**
In this essay, my research community are analyzed through various methods, from a broader scope to a narrower one. Firstly, the distribution of disciplines is classified based on the Criteria of the European Union, Italy, and China, which revealed that my research primarily focuses on mechanical engineering and aeronautical and aerospace engineering.

Secondly, the distribution of disciplines, countries, research institutions, publication titles, and funding agencies in my research community are analyzed based on the keyword search data from the Web of Science platform. The analysis showed that the distribution of disciplines has remained largely unchanged, with the United States, China, and several major EU countries being the most prominent countries. The University of California system ranked first among research institutions, followed by some research institutions in the United States, France, and India. Politecnico di Milano and Beihang University ranked 17th and 21st, respectively. Most of the publications are concentrated in well-known journals in my community, along with some conference proceedings. The funding are primarily from official agencies from China, the United States, and Europe.

Next, based on the readership data from the ResearchGate website over the past eight weeks, which I frequently use, I conducted an analysis of a smaller-scale research community. The overall data did not differ significantly from that of the Web of Science analysis, but the researchers in this community were more concentrated at Politecnico di Milano and Beihang University, which are my doctoral institutions.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Paolo Volonté for his meticulous teaching, diverse classroom formats, and emphasis on interaction and discussion with students, which allowed me to experience a new learning atmosphere. This assignment also enabled me to better understand my research community and gain a clearer understanding of it. I am confident that the knowledge gained from this course, including the results of this assignment, will greatly benefit my future research career.
