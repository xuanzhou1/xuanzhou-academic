Xuan Zhou is currently the Zhuoyue Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Aeronautic Science and Engineering, Beihang University. He obtained the Ph.D. degree at Beihang University (Supervisor: [Prof. Leiting Dong](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/dongleiting/en/index.htm)) and Politecnico di Milano (Supervisor: [Prof. Claudio Sbarufatti](https://www.mecc.polimi.it/en/research/faculty/prof-claudio-sbarufatti)) in 2024. His research interests include structural integrity, airframe digital twins, structural health monitoring, and surrogate modeling. His research is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation of China, and Beihang University, among others. He has published 10 articles in mainstream peer-reviewed journals in aeronautical and mechanical engineering, including the **AIAA Journal (5 articles)** and Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing (MSSP). He has been recognized with several awards, including the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award from the Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics (awarded to 15 recipients annually), the Graduation Honor of Beijing, and the ICCES 2023 Best Student Paper Award.
