He is currently pursuing his double Ph.D. at Politecnico di Milano, Department of Mechanical engineering from eptember 2021 as the second half of his Ph.D. career, while the first half was at Beihang University. His main research interests are the key technologies of the airframe digital twin, including real-time reduced-order modeling, multidisciplinary co-simulation, data fusion of SHM and simulation, etc. He is currently working on the construction of a structural digital twin of a UAV using advanced simulation and machine learning tools. He has published 4 peer-reviewed papers at AIAA J, CMES, et al.
