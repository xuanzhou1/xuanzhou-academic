  abstract = {Accurate load monitoring is essential for constructing reliable load spectra of aeronautical structures, driving the evolution of airframe digital twins during service. However, onboard strain sensors are often omitted in many aircraft due to weight, reliability, and cost constraints, making accurate load tracking challenging. This study proposes an innovative approach combining deep-learning-based strain prediction with an improved inverse-direct method for the in-service load tracking of sensor-limited aircraft. First, a deep-learning model incorporating time-series features is trained on flight test data. It uses flight parameters as input to predict strain at discrete, limited locations with high accuracy, outperforming conventional regression methods. Second, an improved inverse-direct load monitoring approach using reduced-order aerodynamic modes as physically interpretable basis functions is introduced, which enhances the load monitoring accuracy with discrete strain measurement. During service, the strain prediction model integrates with the inverse-direct method, enabling real-time full-field load and deformation tracking using only flight parameters, thus bypassing the need for an extensive sensor network. Experimental validation on a 3.2-m-wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrates superior performance, highlighting the effectiveness of this strain sensor-free methodology. This approach offers a practical pathway for retrofitting existing fleets with airframe digital twin capabilities, while preserving original airframe configurations.},
