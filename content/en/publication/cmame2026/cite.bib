  abstract = {Aerodynamic loads are crucial for the structural safety of aerospace vehicles. However, direct measurement or high-fidelity simulation remains challenging. In service, structural parameters are influenced by multi-source uncertainties, often characterized by limited samples and spatial variability. To address this, this paper proposes a novel aerodynamic load inversion method considering structural field uncertainties, which reconstructs load boundaries from sparse measurements. First, reduced-order modeling (ROM) is employed to project high-dimensional aerodynamic loads into low-dimensional subspaces based on spatial distribution features, transforming the load inversion problem into the prediction of feature coefficients. A physics-data-driven neural network (PDNN) is developed to predict these coefficients, integrating a data-driven module capturing the response-coefficient mapping relationship with a physics-based module that enforces physical consistency. This hybrid design improves the performance under small-sample and high-noise conditions. To model structural field uncertainties, the interval Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve decomposition (IKLD) is adopted to convert uncertain field into a finite set of uncertain parameters. An adaptive Kriging surrogate model (AKSM) is then used for uncertainty propagation, yielding the interval estimation of aerodynamic loads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical and experimental examples, demonstrating its high accuracy, robustness, and practical applicability, even under sparse measurements, noise interference and field uncertainties.},
