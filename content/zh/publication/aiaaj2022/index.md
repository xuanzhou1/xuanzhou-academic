abstract: To deploy the airframe digital twin or to conduct probabilistic
  evaluations of the remaining life of a structural component, a (near)
  real-time crack-growth simulation method is critical. In this paper, a
  reduced-order simulation approach is developed to achieve this goal by
  leveraging two methods. On the one hand, the symmetric Galerkin boundary
  element method–finite element method (SGBEM-FEM) coupling method is combined
  with parametric modeling to generate the database of computed stress intensity
  factors for cracks with various sizes/shapes in a complex structural
  component, by which hundreds of samples are automatically simulated within a
  day. On the other hand, machine learning methods are applied to establish the
  relation between crack sizes/shapes and crack-front stress intensity factors.
  By combining the reduced-order computational model with load inputs and
  fatigue growth laws, a real-time prediction of probabilistic crack growth in
  complex structures with minimum computational burden is realized. In an
  example of a round-robin helicopter component, even though the fatigue crack
  growth is simulated cycle by cycle, the simulation is faster than real-time
  (as compared with the physical test). The proposed approach is a key
  simulation technology toward realizing the digital twin of complex structures,
  which further requires fusion of model predictions with
  flight/inspection/monitoring data.
