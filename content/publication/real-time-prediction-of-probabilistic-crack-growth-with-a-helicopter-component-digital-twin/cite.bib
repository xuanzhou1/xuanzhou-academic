  abstract = {To deploy the airframe digital twin or to conduct probabilistic evaluations of the remaining life of a structural component, a (near) real-time crack-growth simulation method is critical. In this paper, a reduced-order simulation approach is developed to achieve this goal by leveraging two methods. On the one hand, the symmetric Galerkin boundary element method\textendash finite element method (SGBEM-FEM) coupling method is combined with parametric modeling to generate the database of computed stress intensity factors for cracks with various sizes/shapes in a complex structural component, by which hundreds of samples are automatically simulated within a day. On the other hand, machine learning methods are applied to establish the relation between crack sizes/shapes and crack-front stress intensity factors. By combining the reduced-order computational model with load inputs and fatigue growth laws, a real-time prediction of probabilistic crack growth in complex structures with minimum computational burden is realized. In an example of a round-robin helicopter component, even though the fatigue crack growth is simulated cycle by cycle, the simulation is faster than real-time (as compared with the physical test). The proposed approach is a key simulation technology toward realizing the digital twin of complex structures, which further requires fusion of model predictions with flight/inspection/monitoring data.},
