abstract: The design philosophy for airframe safety has experienced evolution
  from static strength, safety life, damage tolerance and durability, to
  individual aircraft tracking, with a trend towards the airframe digital twin
  in the future. The airframe twin driven by the digital thread is a
  multidisciplinary, multi-physical, multi-scale, multi-fidelity, and
  multi-uncertainty virtual simulation system. It uses multi-source data such as
  online sensor monitoring, offline ground inspection, and aircraft operation
  history to reflect and predict the behavior and performance of the
  corresponding airframe physical entity during the entire lifespan. It is
  expected to reform the existing paradigm of airframe usage and maintenance.
  Focusing on fatigue life management, this study proposes five key modeling and
  simulation technologies, which are (a) acquisition of load and damage data,
  (b) multi-scale mechanical modeling of airframes, (c) high-performance
  simulation of damage development, (d) efficient digital twin construction
  based on Reduced Order Modeling (ROM), (e) Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
  assessment considering multi-source uncertainty and heterogeneous data. This
  article discusses the state of the art of the proposed five key technologies
  as well as future research directions, providing reference for the systematic
  study and engineering applications of the airframe digital twin. Â© 2021,
